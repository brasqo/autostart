# autostart
Scripts used to automate my workplace. 

This was originally created for the Windows10 environment (it's current state). Since it's initial creation, I've been forcing myself to become more comfortable with macOS. I'm planning on implementing an OS check so it can determine which OS the script is running on, then running the proper method to perform it's needed task. Want accomidate, Win10+, macOSx 10.12+, and Linux...

Requirements:
-Python 3.5 final
